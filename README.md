# Playstore-analysis
This analysis is done using python. Major libraries used in this projects are pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot. 
This project has answered many questions using data visualisation and gave a good insights.
Applications found on the platform has many factors to consider before getting any success.
In this project I have done data cleaning, handaling missing vales and removed unwanted/harmful things from the dataset, so that when EDA is performed no error occurs.
